  # # Form Field
  #
  # A hand-composed labelled field: binds `<label for>` to the control, gives the
  # hint/error real ids referenced by the control's `aria-describedby`, and injects
  # `invalid`/`required`. The control arrives as a block; spread `**f.input_attrs`
  # onto it to adopt the field's id + aria wiring.
  #
  # ## Use when
  # - Composing a one-off labelled field by hand. For model-backed forms, prefer the
  #   app's form builder — it already does this wiring.
  #
  # ## Accessibility contract
  # - **Guarantees:** a bound `<label for=id>`, hint/error with `#{id}-hint`/`#{id}-error`
  #   ids, and `input_attrs` carrying id + describedby + invalid + required. The
  #   required `*` is a decorative aria-hidden mark on the label.
  # - **You supply:** the control inside the block, spread with `**f.input_attrs`.

    # The teaching playground: flip `required`, set/clear `hint` and `error`, and watch
    # the ARIA rewire — hint/error get real ids referenced by the control's
    # `aria-describedby`; an error also sets `aria-invalid`; required adds the
    # decorative `*` and the control's `required`.
