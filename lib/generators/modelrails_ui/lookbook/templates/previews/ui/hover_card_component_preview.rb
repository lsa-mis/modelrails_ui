  # # Hover Card
  #
  # A rich supplemental card revealed on hover AND keyboard focus of its trigger.
  # `focus-within` keeps it open while you Tab through its content; Escape dismisses
  # (WCAG 1.4.13). Use for enhancement, not as the only path to the content.
  #
  # ## Accessibility contract
  # - **Guarantees:** hover + focus-within reveal; card content Tab-reachable while open;
  #   Escape-dismiss; `role="group"` + `aria-label` when `label:` given.
  # - **You supply:** a `with_trigger` slot (a focusable link/button) and card content.
