module UI
  # # RadioGroup
  #
  # A labelled single-choice control — a `role="radiogroup"` wrapping one native
  # `<input type="radio">` per option, each tied to its own `<label for>`.
  #
  # ## Use when
  # - You are choosing one value from a small, fixed set (a plan, a visibility
  #   level, a cadence).
  #
  # ## Don't use when
  # - There are many or dynamic options — use `ui :select`.
  # - The choice is binary on/off — use `ui :toggle` or `ui :checkbox`.
  #
  # ## Accessibility contract
  # - **Guarantees:** an accessible group name (`aria-label` / `aria-labelledby`),
  #   matched `<label for>`/input `id` per option, and on error `aria-invalid="true"`
  #   plus an `aria-describedby` link to the message.
  # - **You supply:** a group `label:` (or `labelledby:`), `items:` as
  #   `[{ value:, label:, checked?:, disabled?: }]`, and on error `invalid:` +
  #   `describedby:`.

    end

    # Error state: the group carries `aria-invalid="true"` and `aria-describedby`
    # pointing at a sibling `<p>` that holds the message.
    def invalid
    end

    # ## Don't — a radiogroup with no accessible name
    #
    # A `role="radiogroup"` with neither `label:` nor `labelledby:` exposes no
    # accessible name — screen-reader users hear an unlabelled group. Always pass
    # `label:` (or point `labelledby:` at a visible heading).
