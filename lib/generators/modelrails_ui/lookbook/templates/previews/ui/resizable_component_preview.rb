  # # Resizable
  #
  # Drag-to-resize panel layout — two panels separated by a **window splitter**.
  # The handle follows the APG window-splitter pattern: grab it with the mouse, or
  # focus it and drive it with the keyboard.
  #
  # ## Accessibility contract
  # - **Guarantees (WCAG 2.1.1):** each handle is a focusable `role="separator"`
  #   tab stop with the `focus-ring` indicator, an i18n `aria-label`, the
  #   `aria-orientation` it splits across, and a live `aria-valuenow/valuemin/
  #   valuemax` range. Arrow keys resize it (← → horizontal, ↑ ↓ vertical);
  #   Home/End jump to its min/max.
  # - **You supply:** panels with optional `min`/`max`/`default` percentages.
