module UI
  # # Select
  #
  # A styled native `<select>` for single-choice from a known list. You supply the
  # options and an EXTERNAL `<label for>`; an `id` is always emitted so the label can
  # target it. On error, pass `invalid: true` + `describedby:`.
  #
  # ## Use when
  # - You need a single-choice dropdown from a known, finite list of options.
  #
  # ## Don't use when
  # - The control needs free-text entry or async search — that's a combobox.
  #
  # ## Accessibility contract
  # - **Guarantees:** AAA border/focus-ring tokens, an `id` always emitted,
  #   `aria-invalid="true"` when `invalid: true`, and `aria-describedby` wired when
  #   `describedby:` is supplied.
  # - **You supply:** the visible label as an external `<label for="<id>">` — unlike
  #   checkbox, this component does NOT bundle a label.

    # ## Don't — a select with no associated label
    #
    # A `<select>` with no external `<label for="<id>">` has no accessible name —
    # screen-reader users hear only "combobox". Always pair it with a label that
    # targets the emitted id.
