  # # Sheet
  #
  # A native `<dialog>` side panel — pinned to a chosen edge and sliding in
  # from that edge. A flexible overlay for navigation, filters, and secondary
  # forms. Behavior lives in the `modal` Stimulus controller with per-side
  # slide transform values.
  #
  # ## Use when
  # - A side panel is the right pattern for navigation, filters, or secondary
  #   forms that slide in from a screen edge.
  #
  # ## Don't use when
  # - A centered confirm gate is needed — use `alert_dialog`.
  # - A bottom sheet is the right pattern — use `drawer`.
  #
  # ## Accessibility contract
  # - **Guarantees:** native `<dialog>` with `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"`,
  #   `aria-labelledby` wired to the heading, `aria-describedby` when `description:`
  #   is given, a 44px accessible close button, focus trap + restore via the `modal`
  #   controller, and native Escape via the controller's cancel handler.
  # - **You supply:** a `title:` (required — the accessible name). Actions belong in
  #   the `with_footer` slot. The `with_trigger` slot provides the open button. Pass
  #   `side:` to choose which edge the panel slides in from (`:right` default).

    # Default side panel sliding in from the right edge. The `with_trigger` slot
    # renders inside the `modal` controller wrapper so clicking the button calls
    # `modal#open` automatically.
